Abstract: This research study aims to analyze crime trends in Seattle and examine the effects of major events on crime rates. The dataset used in this study was obtained from the official Seattle Police Department (SPD) Crime Data source. The research questions focused on identifying neighborhoods with the highest crime rates, examining changes in crime rates over the past 10 years, identifying interesting patterns in crime rates across different neighborhoods, and investigating the impact of global events such as Covid-19 and the 2008 housing market crash on crime rates.

The methodology employed in this study involved data manipulation and analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Altair. Data cleaning procedures were implemented to handle missing values and restructure the dataset for visualizations. Altair was used for creating graphical visualizations to effectively communicate the findings.

The findings of the study indicate that Downtown Seattle, Capitol Hill, and Queen Anne are the neighborhoods with the highest number of crimes in Seattle. The Northgate area has witnessed a significant increase in crime reports over the past 10 years. Overall, crime rates showed a noticeable spike during the 2020-2021 period, potentially influenced by the Black Lives Matter protests. Furthermore, there was a slight increase in crime rates in various neighborhoods during the Covid-19 pandemic, although it is challenging to establish a definitive causal relationship.

The study highlights some limitations in the graphical visualizations, including faulty axes, deceptive visuals, and issues with legends and color schemes. Additionally, the variability of the data and the large number of data points posed challenges for analysis. However, the visualizations effectively convey the trends and patterns observed in the dataset.

In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights into crime trends in Seattle and the potential impacts of major events on crime rates. The study suggests that socioeconomic prosperity and population density may influence crime rates, but further statistical evidence is needed to support these claims. The findings can be useful for policymakers and law enforcement agencies in developing targeted strategies and allocating resources to areas with higher crime rates.
