# hcde-410-final

Author: Andrew Kwon

This is my final project assignment for HCDE 410. In this project I will be exploring different ways that data can visualize and comprehend different data points. I will hopefully be able to explore visual analysis, AI/ML, and data processing. Through this project I hope I can find ways in which data can help transform communities.
